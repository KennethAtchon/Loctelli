Ah — now we're getting to the real issue. If you're hitting that 'Redis timeout', it means:

this.scrapingQueue.getJobCounts() is not resolving in under 2 seconds, likely due to Redis being slow, overloaded, unavailable, or misconfigured.

Let's debug this surgically.

🔍 Most Likely Causes of Redis Timeout
1. Redis is down or unreachable
Check your Redis instance. Is it up?

Try manually connecting: redis-cli -h <host> -p <port>

If using Docker, maybe the container is restarting or not linked correctly.

2. Redis is overloaded
Too many concurrent connections.

Memory issues (maxmemory hit).

Slow disk/network on hosted Redis (e.g., AWS ElastiCache with poor config).

3. Connection misconfigured
You might not be setting a proper connectTimeout or retry strategy in your Bull config.

🔧 Fixes & Improvements
✅ 1. Set Redis connection timeouts
Make sure Bull is using a reasonable connection timeout and retry strategy.

If you’re on Bull v4 (which uses ioredis under the hood), do something like:

ts
Copy
Edit
new Queue('scraping', {
  redis: {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 6379,
    connectTimeout: 1000,
    maxRetriesPerRequest: 2,
    enableReadyCheck: true
  }
});
These options ensure that:

It won’t hang forever trying to connect.

It will fail fast and retry up to 2 times.

✅ 2. Log slow Redis commands
If you control the Redis instance, enable slowlog:

sh
Copy
Edit
redis-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> CONFIG SET slowlog-log-slower-than 10000
127.0.0.1:6379> SLOWLOG GET
This tells you if something like getJobCounts is causing slow Redis ops.

✅ 3. Increase your app-side timeout
You’re giving it just 2000ms — which is fair, but if Redis is momentarily slow, you're getting a false negative.

Try increasing it slightly:

ts
Copy
Edit
setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Redis timeout')), 5000);
✅ 4. Add circuit-breaker logic
Wrap this in a smarter fault-tolerant pattern so that you:

Don’t hammer Redis during downtime.

Don’t constantly throw errors on timeouts.

We can plug in a circuit-breaker library like opossum if you want.

✅ 5. Use BullMQ instead
If you’re planning a refactor, BullMQ gives more control over Redis connections (especially when using ioredis directly) and tends to behave better under pressure.
