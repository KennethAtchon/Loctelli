Ah, I see exactly what you’re asking — you want to know if you can take the `places.name` (which is basically `places/PLACE_ID`) and just throw it into Google Maps directly, so you don’t have to call the Place Details API and incur billing. Let’s break it down carefully.

---

### 1️⃣ What `places.name` actually is

* `places.name` in the Essentials SKU is **not the human-readable name** — it’s the **resource identifier**, usually like:

```
places/ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4
```

* That last part (`ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4`) **is the actual Place ID**.

* `places.displayName` (Pro SKU) is the **text name** you’d see on Google Maps (“Sydney Opera House”) — that’s what humans read.

---

### 2️⃣ Can you search `places/PLACE_ID` directly on Google Maps?

* No. Google Maps **won’t accept `places/PLACE_ID` as a search query**.
* You **can** use the Place ID itself in a URL format like this:

```
https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4
```

* This will open the place in Google Maps without calling the API. ✅

* But you **cannot just paste `places.name` like `places/ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4`** into Google Maps search — it won’t work.

---

### 3️⃣ Key takeaway

* If your goal is **avoiding API charges**, you **can use the Place ID in a Maps URL** to link users directly to Google Maps.
* But if you want **programmatic info** (address, phone, reviews, etc.), you **must call Place Details** — that’s when the billing applies.

If you want, I can show a **quick trick to generate clickable Google Maps links from a list of `places.name` IDs** so you can completely skip the API call for just viewing places. It’s super useful.

Do you want me to do that?
