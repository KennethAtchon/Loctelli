Please redesign our AI booking system:

CURRENTLY 
It looks for a text BOOKING_CONFIRMATION, and then uses this text and filters it to book. This is absolutely terrible because there are chances for 
mistakes and the AI will show its booking data to the user.

----------------------------

GOAL: CREATE A TOOL CALL FOR BOOKING

Yep — if you’re on the **OpenAI API** (the `chat.completions` endpoint with GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-3.5-turbo, etc.), you *do* have structured output support.

There are two flavors you can use:

---

### 🔹 1. **Function Calling (tool calls)**

You define functions (tools) with a JSON schema, and the model will call them when it detects intent.
Example:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o-mini",
  messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Book a meeting with Alice tomorrow at 2pm"}
  ],
  tools=[
    {
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "book_meeting",
        "description": "Book a calendar event",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "time": {"type": "string", "description": "ISO 8601 datetime"},
            "participants": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {"type": "string"},
              "description": "Emails of participants"
            }
          },
          "required": ["time", "participants"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
)
```

When the user says *“Book a meeting…”*, instead of spitting out `[BOOKING_CONFIRMATION]`, the model will return:

```json
{
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "id": "call_abc123",
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "book_meeting",
        "arguments": "{ \"time\": \"2025-09-08T14:00:00Z\", \"participants\": [\"alice@example.com\"] }"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

💡 You then just call your booking API with those args. The **user only sees** a natural reply like:

> “Sure, I’ve scheduled it with Alice for tomorrow at 2 PM.”

---

### 🔹 2. **Structured Outputs (beta, cleaner)**

You can skip defining “tools” and instead tell the model: *“always output a JSON object that matches this schema”*.
Example:

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4.1",
  messages=[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Book a meeting with Alice tomorrow at 2pm"}
  ],
  response_format={
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
      "name": "meeting_schema",
      "schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "time": {"type": "string"},
          "participants": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
        },
        "required": ["time", "participants"]
      }
    }
  }
)
```

Then the model *only* returns:

```json
{
  "time": "2025-09-08T14:00:00Z",
  "participants": ["alice@example.com"]
}
```

This is pure structured data (not conversational), so you’d likely pair it with a separate natural-language response if you want chat + booking.

---

👉 **My take**:

* Use **function calling** if you want “AI talks naturally *and* triggers bookings.”
* Use **structured outputs** if you’re building a pipeline where you only care about clean data, not the chit-chat.

---

Do you want me to show you a hybrid pattern — where the AI *both* responds naturally to the user **and** secretly gives you structured booking JSON in the same API call?

We maybe need a tool to check the availability of the user's calendar
