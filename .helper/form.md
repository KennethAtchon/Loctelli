Make a public form page for my application, with a table in the backend - similar to contact us, but I want to be able to change this form page regularly, so the table has to be flexible,
it should have a row in admin dashboard to view, like contact table
and it should use r2 to upload images
Just use a json for dynamic generation, make the table look good, it can have multiple jsons
The topic for now is:
1. We are onboarding users with a facebook ads plus ghl system
2. We need details to set it up, as relates to their business and stuff
3. so everything needed for GHL system to work
4. Everything needed for us to help them setup facebook ads

Also side note, when users visit the page, we need a way to wake up the postgresql in the background, since I have it set to sleep...and we need to keep poking the bear while a user is on this page
