create a markdown research file, do deep research, my goal is to create a card style form system, but keep the existing simple-form we have now, and do a rebrand of the current form to simple form, the card style from will have really good animating for each card form, have it like this question on top, then image, then multiple choice or enter text or whatever, basically an enhance version of the current implementation, we will also add fields to the admin panel form system to make this card system actually work as intended, admins can choose to either create an ehanced card form or a simple form, etc, etc, so create a doc with all these features AND MORE features that would be better, also at the end of the card creation, we can maybe have a user profile estimator (based on the clients answers to the questions, we can have an AI enhanced or not, algorithm that computes the end goal), like the form is about how much of an outdoor person you are, and we compute that its 80% given the questions

fix tests

ok so now double check EVERYTHING, when a user creates something with json, the json is the exact same as if they are creating it manually, confirm this to be the case
