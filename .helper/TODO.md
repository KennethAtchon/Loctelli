fix ghl integrations

ghl api calls for auto changing tags/opportunities

in ghl integrations in frontend, need a way for it to download snapshot/ fix it


-------

Can you add a parameters/config field to API keys, this will allow me to give different options to the user based on the api key,
right now this is a feature for the business finder, I intend to expand
So we pre-configuration what we want each API key to have in terms of parameters (and what they allow us to filter),
then the frontend UI will change dynamically to accustom that,
seamless experience for the user
