### How Real-Time Feedback Is Implemented

- **Backend (NestJS):**
  - The `QueueProcessorService` and `BuildWorkerService` handle build jobs. As a job progresses, `BuildWorkerService` calls `BuildQueueService.updateJobProgress`, which updates the jobâ€™s progress and current step in the database.
  - The `QueueProcessorService` uses `RealTimeNotificationService` to send real-time job updates to users. This is done via Server-Sent Events (SSE), as seen in `RealTimeNotificationService.handleSSEConnection` and `sendJobUpdate`.
  - The controller exposes an endpoint (`/user/queue/stream`) that establishes an SSE connection for the frontend to receive updates.

- **Frontend:**
  - The frontend can connect to the `/user/queue/stream` endpoint to receive real-time updates about build jobs.

### Is the Feedback Dynamic?

- **Yes, the infrastructure is in place for dynamic, real-time feedback.**
  - As the build job progresses, the backend sends updates (progress, current step, status) to the frontend via SSE.
  - The updates are triggered at various stages of the build process (e.g., extracting files, installing dependencies, building, starting preview server).

### Potential Gaps

- If you are not seeing real-time feedback on the frontend, possible reasons could be:
  - The frontend is not connecting to the SSE endpoint or not handling the events.
  - The backend is not sending frequent enough updates (e.g., only at major steps, not granular progress).
  - There may be a bug in the notification or SSE connection logic.

---

**Next Steps:**
- Check the frontend code to ensure it is connecting to `/user/queue/stream` and handling `job_update` events.
- If the connection exists but updates are infrequent, consider adding more granular progress updates in the backend.
- If the connection is missing or broken, debug the SSE connection setup on both backend and frontend.

Would you like me to investigate the frontend implementation for handling these real-time build job updates?
