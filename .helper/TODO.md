ghl api calls for auto changing tags/opportunities

in ghl integrations in frontend, need a way for it to download snapshot/ fix it

Uncaught TypeError: navigator.vibrate is not a function

For the Integration for GHL


Lets make this functional, create a plan - Please create an overview on how GHL integrations currently work, literally how it flows and everything

We need to stop using env api key for GHL and version and include it in the GHL integration, I think the flow already kinda works - by taking the location id and looking for an integration, since one integration per subaccount, we can find the subaccount thats attached on our side, then the rest of the flow seams to work 

Ultimate goal is to get it to work seamless from the frontend,  completely independent from ENVs

---------

THIS WILL REPLACE THE BOOKING_CONFIRMATION flag and make it more seamless

1. Structured JSON — not shown to the user

You don’t actually need to print the JSON to the user. Modern APIs (OpenAI’s function calling, Anthropic’s tool use) let you say:

“Hey model, if you detect a booking intent, instead of just answering in natural text, also output this structured JSON object that matches my schema.”

The user only sees:

“Got it, I’ve scheduled a meeting for tomorrow at 2 PM with Alice.”

Meanwhile, your app receives both that text and a separate structured object you can directly pass to your booking API.

So no ugly JSON dump in chat. It’s invisible to the end user.
