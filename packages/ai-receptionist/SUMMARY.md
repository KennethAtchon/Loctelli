## 💰 Business Model (from earlier discussion)

### Hybrid Open-Source Strategy:
- **Open-source:** Client SDK (`@loctelli/ai-receptionist`)
- **Proprietary:** Hosted infrastructure (`ai-receptionist.loctelli.com`)

### Pricing (Estimated):
```
Free Tier:  10 calls/month (for GitHub stars)
Starter:    $99/mo  - 100 calls
Pro:        $299/mo - 500 calls + analytics
Enterprise: Custom  - unlimited + white-label
```

### Revenue Potential:
- Month 1-3: $0 (build + launch)
- Month 4-6: $500-2,000 (early adopters)
- Month 7-12: $5,000-20,000 (if PMF achieved)
- Year 2+: $50,000-200,000 (if full-time)

## 🎯 Target Market

**Primary:** Service businesses (10-50 employees)
- HVAC companies
- Roofing contractors
- Plumbing services
- Landscaping businesses
- Home repair services
- Electricians
- Pest control

**Pain Point:** Missing calls = lost revenue
**Solution:** AI answers 24/7, qualifies, and books automatically

## 📝 What You Need to Decide

- [ ] Build as separate product (`ai-receptionist.loctelli.com`)?
- [ ] Build into Loctelli CRM as feature?
- [ ] Build separate, then integrate later?

### 3. **Monetization Question**
- [ ] Open-source SDK + charge for hosting?
- [ ] Keep everything proprietary?
- [ ] Build for Loctelli only first?

### 4. **Timeline Question**
- [ ] MVP in 3 months?
- [ ] MVP in 6 months?
- [ ] Just validate idea first?
