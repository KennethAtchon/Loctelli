# Loctelli Frontend - Environment Variables
# ============================================
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# Never commit .env to version control!

# ============================================
# Backend API Configuration
# ============================================
# Backend URL for server-side proxy requests (runtime)
# Used by /api/proxy route to forward requests to backend
# In development, defaults to http://localhost:8000
# In production, set to your backend URL
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

# API Key for server-side requests (runtime)
# Used by proxy route to authenticate with backend
# This is server-side only and not exposed to the client
API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# ============================================
# Client-Side Configuration (Build-time)
# ============================================
# These variables are embedded in the client bundle at build time
# They must be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ to be accessible in the browser

# Debug mode (client-side)
# Set to "true" for development, "false" for production
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG=true

# Public API URL (optional, legacy)
# If you need a different API URL exposed to the client
# Note: The app uses /api/proxy by default, so this may not be needed
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/proxy

# ============================================
# Notes
# ============================================
# - Variables without NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix are server-side only
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are embedded in the client bundle
# - BACKEND_URL and API_KEY are accessed at runtime on the server
# - All API calls should use /api/proxy to avoid CORS issues
